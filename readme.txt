Vertilyzer Adapter Set for MSX computers with front/side slots
Copyright (c) 2024 by RBSC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The RBSC presents the set of adapters for computers with front or side cartridge slots. The purpose of these adapters
is to change the orientation of inserted cartridges in order to insert them vertically and to face a user. This is
especially important for diagnostic cartridges (iBolit, Barmaley), cartridges with screens (EMUFDC) or for cartridges
with blinking LED lights (MSX-EQ and others). Computers with front slots include Daewoo 400S, Yamaha YIS805, Sony F500,
F700 or F900 and many others.

As front slots are implemented differently in different MSX computers, two different variants of Vertilyzer adapters are
available. For example, Yamaha's front slot requires a cartridge to be inserted label-down while in Sony F500 a cartridge
is inserted label-up. Vertilyzer helps to insert any cartridge vertically, with the label's side facing a user.

So, there are 2 different models of Vertilyzer: A and B. They are intended for 2 different groups of MSX computers.

The Model A is suitable for:

 - Yamaha YIS-805
 - Pioneer PX-7
 - National CF-3000
 - Philips 8250 (has side slots, but could be still usable)

The Model B is suitable for:

 - Daewoo CPC 400 and 400S
 - Sony F500, F700 and F900

The Model B adapter is supplied with the special bracket to activate the power switch on Sony MSX computers. Both adapters
are designed in 2-color 3D-printed cases. The cases have screw holes, but they are designed to be closed firmly without
screws. The circuit board may a bit wobble inside the case - this is done on purpose, to allow stressless inserting of the
adapter into the cartridge slot.

Each board must have a "key" to ensure that cartridges are inserted correctly. It is recommended to use male brass hex
4mm high support column (those are used on PC motherboards in othe electronics) with M3 thread together with an M3 nut
as a key. There is a hole marked "Pin hole" on the adapter's board for installing the key. The installed support column
must not be higher than the installed 50-pin slot.

The only other part that is necessary to build the adapter is the 50-pin industrial cartridge slot. Such slots could be
found on AliExpress when searching for "Edge Card Connector Slot 2.54 mm Pitch". There may be different sizes, so please
order only 50-pin or 2x25-pin slots.

In order to insert the adapter properly, please push it into the slot using both thumbs placed on the "PUSH" tiles. Make
sure that the adapter is properly inserted before powering up a computer.
